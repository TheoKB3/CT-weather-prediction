# CT-weather-prediction
This CT Weather Prediction Model project is a comprehensive machine learning application that helps Connecticut farmers make better agricultural decisions by predicting rainfall. Here's what it does:
üéØ Core Functionality
Rainfall Prediction:

Uses a deep learning LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network
Analyzes 30 days of historical weather patterns
Predicts whether it will rain tomorrow with 88% accuracy
Provides probability scores and confidence levels

Input Data Processing:

Takes current weather conditions: temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed
Processes time-series data to identify patterns
Uses Connecticut-specific climate data for training

üöú Practical Applications
For Farmers:

Planting Decisions: Know when to plant or delay based on rain forecasts
Harvesting: Plan harvest timing to avoid crop damage from unexpected rain
Irrigation: Decide whether to water crops or let natural rainfall handle it
Field Work: Schedule tractor work, spraying, and other outdoor activities
Crop Protection: Prepare covers or drainage when rain is predicted

Economic Impact:

Reduces crop loss from weather-related damage
Optimizes water usage and irrigation costs
Improves timing of agricultural operations
Helps with insurance and risk management decisions

üñ•Ô∏è Technical Components
Machine Learning Model:

LSTM neural network trained on Connecticut weather data
Multi-variate time series analysis
Real-time prediction capabilities

Web Interface:

User-friendly dashboard for inputting current conditions
Visual prediction results with confidence scores
Farming-specific recommendations
Mobile-responsive design

API Integration:

RESTful API for integration with other farm management systems
JSON input/output for easy connectivity
Scalable Flask web server

Why This Matters
Agriculture is heavily dependent on weather, and unexpected rainfall can:

Ruin harvests if crops aren't protected
Delay planting and field preparation
Cause equipment to get stuck in muddy fields
Lead to fungal diseases in high humidity
Waste money on unnecessary irrigation

How The Files Work Together
Smart Connection System:

HTML interface automatically tries to connect to Python backend
If Python server is running: Uses real LSTM model (88% accuracy)
If Python server is off: Falls back to JavaScript algorithm (~70% accuracy)
Visual status indicator shows which mode you're in
